TellApart Practice Challenge - OO File System

OO File System
--------------
The assignment is to design and implement an in­memory file system. Choose whatever OO language you are comfortable with – preferably Java or Python. And there is no time limit on this search either.

This file­system consists of 4 types of entities: Drives, Folders, Text files, Zip files.

These entities, very much like their “real” file­system counterparts, obey the following relations.

- A folder, a drive or a zip file, may contain zero to many other folders, or files (text or zip).
- A text file does not contain any other entity.
- A drive is not contained in any entity.
- Any non­drive entity must be contained in another entity.

If entity A contains entity B then we say that A is the parent of B. 

Every entity has the following properties:

- Type – The type of the entity (one of the 4 type above).
- Name ­ An alphanumeric string. Two entities with the same parent cannot have the same name. Similarly, two drives cannot have the same name.
- Path – The concatenation of the names of the containing entities, from the drive down to and including the entity. The names are separated by ‘\’.
- A text file has a property called Content which is a string.
- Size – an integer defined as follows:
	- For a text file – it is the length of its content.
	- For a drive or a folder, it is the sum of all sizes of the entities it contains.
	- For a zip file, it is one half of the sum of all sizes of the entities it contains.

The system should be capable of supporting file­system like operations

- Create – Creates a new entity.
	- Arguments: Type, Name, Path of parent.
	- Exceptions: Path not found; Path already exists; Illegal File System Operation (if any of the rules a­d above is violated).
- Delete – Deletes an existing entity (and all the entities it contains).
	- Arguments: Path
	- Exceptions: Path not found.
- Move – Changing the parent of an entity.
	- Arguments: Source Path, Destination Path.
	- Exceptions: Path not found; Path already exists, Illegal File System Operation.
- WriteToFile – Changes the content of a text file.
	- Arguments: Path, Content
	- Exceptions: Path not found; Not a text file.

__Tasks:__

- Come up with the design for this system. Full implementation is not required, but only to the level which you feel is a “proof of concept”.
- Show a sketch of implementation of the Move operation.
- Explicitly implement the property Size.
